# System Design Documentation

## Goals of the Current System Design

An Appointment Service is typically a backend or middleware component of an application that manages scheduling, booking, and other functionalities related to appointments. This service is commonly used in industries like healthcare, salons, business meetings, and service-based platforms where users need to schedule time slots with professionals or resources.

- *Database Engines:* Through a basic repository interface, supporting any SQL database through PrismaORM (Tested with MySQL).

## Technology Stack

1. Node.js
2. TypeScript
3. PrismaORM
4. MySQL

## Recommended Tools on Development Machine

- Visual Studio Code with the following extensions:
  - ESLint
  - DotENV
  - Prettier Code Formatter by Prettier
- MySQL Workbench
- Postman

## Setup

- Database migration is done automatically on launching the application.
- Testing the service with Postman: A comprehensive set of Postman requests is available in the collection `appointment-zone.postman_collection.json`.
- Import the Postman collection JSON file.
- It is advisable to execute the requests in sequential order from top-to-bottom.

## System Goals

1. *Open Architecture:*
   -Support for various types of appointments by defining a reusable interface for Appointment entities.
   - Enable users to extend or customize the system to accommodate additional appointment types or business logic.

2. *Versioning and History:*
   - Support versioning to track changes made to appointments.
   - Provide APIs to retrieve historical data and revert to previous states if necessary.

3. *Scalability and Performance:*
   - Handle large volumes of appointment data efficiently.
   - Optimize for high throughput and low latency.

4. *Audit Logging and Monitoring:*
   - Implement audit trails to log all actions performed within the system for accountability and debugging.
   - Integrate monitoring tools for real-time performance tracking and issue detection.
 
5. *Customization and Extensibility:* 
   - Provide APIs or hooks for users to integrate custom logic or external services.
   - Ensure flexibility for future features like advanced scheduling algorithms or external calendar synchronization.

## Service Purpose

The Appointment Service handles the creation, organization, retrieval, and management of appointments. It ensures seamless scheduling while maintaining data integrity, security, and performance.

## Key Components

1. *Appointment Entity:*
   - Represents the core object of the system, containing attributes like:
     id, title, description, date, time, status, and metadata.
   - Tracks essential information about each appointment, including its lifecycle state.

2. *Appointment Repository:*
   - Abstracts interaction with the database using PrismaORM.
   - Handles CRUD operations and supports advanced queries, such as filtering by date or customer.

3. *Appointment Service:*
   - Implements business logic, including:
        - Appointment creation with validation.
        - Availability checks to avoid conflicts.
        - Sending notifications for confirmation or cancellation.

4. *Search and Indexing Module:*
   - Enables searching appointments by criteria such as date, status, or customer.
   - Supports paginated and sorted results for better performance.

5. *Security and Access Control:*
   - Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict unauthorized actions.
   - Ensures sensitive information is only visible to authorized users.

## Design Considerations

- *Scalability:*
  - Use database indexing to improve query performance.
  - Optimize API endpoints for large-scale appointment data.

- *Audit Trail:*
  - Log all actions (creation, updates, cancellations) to ensure traceability.
  - Store logs securely and allow for easy retrieval during audits.

- *Extensibility:*
  - Provide a way to define and manage different types of Documents for users to customize based on their needs.

- *Integration:*
  - Define clear interfaces for adding new features or logic.
  - Provide hooks for integrating third-party scheduling algorithms or services.


## Control Flow of the System

1. Incoming Request:
    - Requests are processed through a standard middleware pipeline (e.g., authentication, logging).

2. Router:
    - Each route is handled by a specific router file, mapping the endpoint to its corresponding controller   function.

3. Validation:
    - Validators (using Joi) validate incoming requests, ensuring data is complete and conforms to the expected    format.
    - Validated data is converted into domain models.

4. Controller:
    - The controller accepts validated domain models and delegates business logic to services.

5. Service Layer:
    - Business logic is implemented in services, which may interact with other services or the database.
      
6. Repository:
    - Repositories convert domain models into database models and perform necessary database operations.

7. Response:
    - Database models are mapped to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and returned to the controller.
      The controller formats the DTO into a standard response object before sending it back to the client.
